# Sliver Example

This is an example app for the use of Sliver in flutter.

You can follow the tutorial [part1](https://medium.com/flutter-community/slivers-deep-dive-series-introduction-to-slivers-and-sliverappbar-c8912ac358c2) and [part2](https://medium.com/flutter-community/slivers-deep-dive-series-slivertoboxadapter-sliverlist-and-sliverfixedextentlist-80c2f1ad2f93).

## Branches

The `master` Branch has the code without the use of the slivers.

The branch `step_1_final` contains the code with the use of the SliverAppBar.

Branch `step_2_final` demonstrates the end project with the whole scrolling is implemented with slivers.
